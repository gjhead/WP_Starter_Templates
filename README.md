# WP_Starter_Templates
Personal Starter files for when building regular 'ole front-end files for use in a Wordpress Template

Most likely not much of a use to anyone else, but I often create front-end files that need to be integrated into a Wordpress system.  I generally *always* build out templates first, then do a bunch of Wordpress stuff.  This is how I start.

These files are in flux a lot, mostly on GitHub for my own use to have a central place to save them.
